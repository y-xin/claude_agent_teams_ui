## Why This Exists

### Claude Code stopped telling you what it's doing.

Recent Claude Code updates replaced detailed tool output with opaque summaries. `Read 3 files`. `Searched for 1 pattern`. `Edited 2 files`. No paths, no content, no line numbers. The context usage indicator became a three-segment progress bar with no breakdown. To get the details back, the only option is `--verbose` — which dumps raw JSON, internal system prompts, and thousands of lines of noise into your terminal.

**There is no middle ground in the CLI.** You either see too little or too much.

Claude Agent Teams UI restores the information that was taken away — structured, searchable, and without a single modification to Claude Code itself. It reads the raw session logs from `~/.claude/` and reconstructs the full execution trace: every file path that was read, every regex that was searched, every diff that was applied, every token that was consumed — organized into a visual interface you can actually reason about.

### The wrapper problem.

There are many GUI wrappers for Claude Code — Conductor, Craft Agents, Vibe Kanban, 1Code, ccswitch, and others. None of them solved the actual problem:

**They wrap Claude Code.** They inject their own prompts, add their own abstractions, and change how Claude behaves. If you love the terminal — and I do — you don't want that. You want Claude Code exactly as it is.

**They only show their own sessions.** Run something in the terminal? It doesn't exist in their UI. You can only see what was executed through *their* tool. The terminal and the GUI are two separate worlds.

**You can't debug what went wrong.** A session failed — but why? The context filled up too fast — but what consumed it? A subagent spawned 5 child agents — but what did they do? Even in the terminal, scrolling back through a long session to reconstruct what happened is nearly impossible.

**You can't monitor what matters.** Want to know when Claude reads `.env`? When a single tool call exceeds 4K tokens of context? When a teammate sends a shutdown request? You'd have to wire up hooks manually, every time, for every project.

**Claude Agent Teams UI takes a different approach.** It doesn't wrap or modify Claude Code at all. It reads the session logs that already exist on your machine (`~/.claude/`) and turns them into a rich, interactive interface — regardless of whether the session ran in the terminal, in an IDE, or through another tool.

> Zero configuration. No API keys. Works with every session you've ever run.

## Key Features

### :mag: Visible Context Reconstruction

<img width="100%" alt="context" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff4a5a7-bcf6-47fb-8ca5-d4021540804b" />

Claude Code doesn't expose what's actually in the context window. Claude Agent Teams UI reverse-engineers it.

The engine walks each turn of the session and reconstructs the full set of context injections — **CLAUDE.md files** (broken down by global, project, and directory-level), **skill activations**, **@-mentioned files**, **tool call inputs and outputs**, **extended thinking**, **team coordination overhead**, and **user prompt text**.

The result is a per-turn breakdown of estimated token attribution across 7 categories, surfaced in three places: a **Context Badge** on each assistant response, a **Token Usage popover** with percentage breakdowns, and a dedicated **Session Context Panel**.

### :chart_with_downwards_trend: Compaction Visualization

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25281f09-05ed-4f81-97bc-7b1754b08b06" controls="controls" muted="muted" style="max-width: 100%;"></video>

**See the moment your context hits the limit.**

When Claude Code hits its context limit, it silently compresses your conversation and continues. Most tools don't even notice this happened.

Claude Agent Teams UI detects these compaction boundaries, measures the token delta before and after, and visualizes how your context fills, compresses, and refills over the course of a session. You can see exactly what was in the window at any point, and how the composition shifted after each compaction event.


### :bell: Custom Notification Triggers

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b07b3b4-57af-49ed-9539-be7c56a244f5" controls="controls" muted="muted" style="max-width: 100%;"></video>

Define rules for when you want to receive **system notifications**. Match on regex patterns, assign colors, and filter your inbox by trigger.

- **Built-in defaults**: `.env File Access Alert`, `Tool Result Error` (`is_error: true`), and `High Token Usage` (default: 8,000 total tokens).
- **Custom matching**: use regex against specific fields like `file_path`, `command`, `prompt`, `content`, `thinking`, or `text`.
- **Sensitive-file monitoring**: create alerts for `.env`, `secrets`, payment/billing/stripe paths, or any project-specific pattern.
- **Noise control**: choose input/output/total token thresholds, add ignore patterns, and scope triggers to selected repositories.


### :hammer_and_wrench: Rich Tool Call Inspector

Every tool call is paired with its result in an expandable card. Specialized viewers render each tool natively:
- **Read** calls show syntax-highlighted code with line numbers
- **Edit** calls show inline diffs with added/removed highlighting
- **Bash** calls show command output
- **Subagent** calls show the full execution tree, expandable in-place


### :busts_in_silhouette: Team & Subagent Visualization

Claude Code now spawns subagents via the Task tool and coordinates entire teams via `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and `TaskUpdate`. In the terminal, all of this collapses into an unreadable stream. Claude Agent Teams UI untangles it.

- **Subagent sessions** are resolved from Task tool calls and rendered as expandable inline cards — each with its own tool trace, token metrics, duration, and cost. Nested subagents (agents spawning agents) render as a recursive tree.
- **Teammate messages** — sent via `SendMessage` with color and summary metadata — are detected and rendered as distinct color-coded cards, separated from regular user messages. Each teammate is identified by name and assigned color.
- **Team lifecycle** is fully visible: `TeamCreate` initialization, `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` coordination, `SendMessage` direct messages and broadcasts, shutdown requests and responses, and `TeamDelete` teardown.
- **Session summary** shows distinct teammate count separately from subagent count, so you can tell at a glance how many agents participated and how work was distributed.

### :zap: Command Palette & Cross-Session Search

Hit **Cmd+K** for a Spotlight-style command palette. Search across all sessions in a project — results show context snippets with highlighted keywords. Navigate directly to the exact message.

### :globe_with_meridians: SSH Remote Sessions

Connect to any remote machine over SSH and inspect Claude Code sessions running there — same interface, no compromise.

Claude Agent Teams UI parses your `~/.ssh/config` for host aliases, supports agent forwarding, private keys, and password auth, then opens an SFTP channel to stream session logs from the remote `~/.claude/` directory. Each SSH host gets its own isolated service context with independent caches, file watchers, and parsers. Switching between local and remote workspaces is instant — the app snapshots your current state to IndexedDB before the switch and restores it when you return, tabs and all.

### :bar_chart: Multi-Pane Layout

Open multiple sessions side-by-side. Drag-and-drop tabs between panes, split views, and compare sessions in parallel — like a proper IDE for your AI conversations.

## What the CLI Hides vs. What Claude Agent Teams UI Shows

| What you see in the terminal | What Claude Agent Teams UI shows you |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `Read 3 files` | Exact file paths, syntax-highlighted content with line numbers |
| `Searched for 1 pattern` | The regex pattern, every matching file, and the matched lines |
| `Edited 2 files` | Inline diffs with added/removed highlighting per file |
| A three-segment context bar | Per-turn token attribution across 7 categories — CLAUDE.md breakdown, skills, @-mentions, tool I/O, thinking, teams, user text — with compaction visualization showing how context fills, compresses, and refills |
| Subagent output interleaved with the main thread | Isolated execution trees per agent, expandable inline with their own metrics |
| Teammate messages buried in session logs | Color-coded teammate cards with name, message, and full team lifecycle visibility |
| Critical events mixed into normal output | Trigger-filtered notification inbox for `.env` access, payment-related file paths, execution errors, and high token usage |
| `--verbose` JSON dump | Structured, filterable, navigable interface — no noise |

## Docker / Standalone Deployment

Run Claude Agent Teams UI without Electron — in Docker, on a remote server, or anywhere Node.js runs.

### Quick Start (Docker Compose)

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:3456` in your browser.

### Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
docker build -t claude-agent-teams-ui .
docker run -p 3456:3456 -v ~/.claude:/data/.claude:ro claude-agent-teams-ui
```

### Quick Start (Node.js)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm standalone:build
node dist-standalone/index.cjs
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_ROOT` | `~/.claude` | Path to the `.claude` data directory |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `PORT` | `3456` | Listen port |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` (standalone) | CORS origin policy (`*`, specific origin, or comma-separated list) |

### Notes

- **Real-time updates may be slower than Electron.** The Electron app uses native file system watchers with IPC for instant updates. The Docker/standalone server uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) over HTTP, which may introduce slight delays when sessions are actively being written to.
- **Custom Claude root path.** If your `.claude` directory is not at `~/.claude`, update the volume mount to point to the correct location:
  ```bash
  # Example: Claude root at /home/user/custom-claude-dir
  docker run -p 3456:3456 -v /home/user/custom-claude-dir:/data/.claude:ro claude-agent-teams-ui

  # Or with docker compose, set the CLAUDE_DIR env variable:
  CLAUDE_DIR=/home/user/custom-claude-dir docker compose up
  ```

### Security-Focused Deployment

The standalone server has **zero** outbound network calls. For maximum isolation:

```bash
docker run --network none -p 3456:3456 -v ~/.claude:/data/.claude:ro claude-agent-teams-ui
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for a full audit of network activity.
